    "# Finding and drawing contours\n",
    "So up until this point in the course we have been able to apply methods like thresholding (Module 1.9) and edge detection (Module 1.10) to detect the outlines and structures of objects in images.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, now that we have the outlines and structures of the objects in images, the big question becomes: How do we find and access these outlines?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer: contours.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll say this many times before this lesson is over, but contours are an invaluable tool to have in your tool belt. Being able to leverage simple contour properties enables you to solve complicated problems with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding and Drawing Contours\n",
    "Before we can utilize contour properties to identify X’s and O’s on a tic-tac-toe board or identify Tetris blocks, we first need to understand how to find contours in an image and draw them.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned in the introduction to this lesson, contours are simply the outlines of an object in an image. If the image is simple enough, we might be able to get away with using the grayscale image as an input.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for more complicated images, we must first find the object by using methods such as edge detection or thresholding — we are simply seeking a binary image where white pixels correspond to objects in an image and black pixels as the background. There are many ways to obtain a binary image like this, but the most used methods are edge detection and thresholding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaway: For better accuracy you’ll normally want to utilize a binary image rather than a grayscale image. We’ll use both binary and grayscale images in this lesson. But once we start to get to some of the more advanced contour topics, you’ll notice that we switch from grayscale to binary images to improve our contour accuracy."

If we did not specify this flag and instead used cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE , we would be storing every single (x, y)-coordinate along the contour. In general, this not advisable. It’s substantially slower and takes up significantly more memory. By compressing our horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments into only end-points we are able to reduce memory consumption significantly without any substantial loss in contour accuracy. You can read more about the compression of contours in the\n",

Personally, I like to always supply a value of -1 and just supply the single contour manually. Doing this is slightly more Pythonic and easier to read — I’ll make this point clear later in this lesson.\n",
